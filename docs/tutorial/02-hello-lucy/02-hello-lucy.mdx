# Lesson 2: Hello, Lucy!

## Objectives

1. Accept input from a user.
2. Write a code comment.
3. Piece together words into bigger words.

## Intro

There's a dog named Lucy, and you're going to be writing some programs to help
take care of her.

She's smart, so though she might never figure out "Who's a good dog?", you need
to first introduce yourself before she'll let you help take care of her.

## Starting a new project

Just like before, start a new project.

```bash
$ alr init --bin hello_lucy
```

You'll notice this time that the name of the `gpr` file is now `hello_lucy.gpr`
and that the only `.adb` file is now called `hello_lucy.adb`.  Open up `hello_lucy.adb`
to get started.

## Remembering from last time

See if you can print a hello message to Lucy with what you learned from the last
lesson.

Remember, you want to print a line of text and that capability is within Ada's
Text Input/Output package of `Ada.Text_IO`.  Bring that package in as a
dependency using `with` and then print a hello message to Lucy.

What you have should look something along the lines of this:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Hello_Lucy is
begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Hello, Lucy!");
end Hello_Lucy;
```

## Commenting about your code

Most programming languages have a way of writing things in your code that the
computer will ignore.  Usually these are called "comments".  Programmers use
them to write notes for themselves for other programmers in the code to describe
why things are done a certain way, indicate tricky spots, or remind themselves of
additional work to do.

Ada comments start with two dashes (negative signs) and continue to the end of
the line, and so are called "line comments".  Your text editor might highlight
the comment a different color to show that it's a comment.

I'm going to annotate the above program with comments -- none of the
things I added change the meaning of the program, from the computer's point of
view.

```ada
--  This is the context clause.
--  We're describing how we depend on the Ada package, and in particular,
--  the Text_IO package inside of the Ada package.  The period (also called a
--  "full stop") indicates that the thing on the right is contained in the
--  thing on the left.
with Ada.Text_IO;

--  Our program starts here.
procedure Hello_Lucy is
  --  This is where we'd describe places to save information, called
  -- "variables" if they can change, and "constants" if they cannot.
  --  There's a few other things we can put here which we won't talk about
  --  yet.
begin  --  The program begins executing statements here
   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Hello, Lucy!");  --  Say hello to Lucy!
end Hello_Lucy; --  end of the program
--  This line is after the program.
```

## Telling Lucy your name

Using this starting point, you're going to accept some input and then print the
greeting with your name.

There's a lot of other pieces of code you can use within `Ada.Text_IO`.  The
one that you're going to use, is a function called `Get_Line`.  This waits for
input from the user and then returns it as a group of characters, which is
usually called a "string".

You want to store your name, which is a string of characters, and assign it the
value produced from your input by the `Get_Line` function.

## Variables

You want to get and then store your name somewhere, which you'll do
with a "variable."  Variables provide a way to point to place of
storage with a name which indentifies that location.

"constants" are sort of like variables, but they're constant and can't change
once set... because they're constant...

Ada also requires you to specify the "type" of the variable.  This helps the
computer check for silly mistakes, like if you tried to determine the square
root of a string of characters.

If we drew a picture of this, it'd look like this:

<div style="width: 10rem; text-align: center">
<VariableSvg />
</div>

You write variables very similarly to use, but with a colon (`:`) in between
the name and the type.

<div className={styles.centeredImage}>
<VariableNotationSvg />
</div>

You're trying to make a variable of type `String`.  So far, you know that what
you need is:

```ada
My_Name : String
```

To assign a variable, you follow this by a colon and equal pair (`:=`) and then
the value you want to give the variable.  This looks a bit weird; back in the
old days, some text editors would show this as leftward arrow (‚Üê) indicating
what this does -- it places the value to the right inside the place given by
the name to the left.

You're getting the value from the `Get_Line` function from the `Ada.Text_IO`
package, and then telling the computer that this is the end of this piece of
code with a semicolon (`;`).

```ada
My_Name : String := Ada.Text_IO.Get_Line;
```

Extra saved data goes between `is` and `begin`, which is where you'll make
your variable.

Putting this all together:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Hello_Lucy is
   My_Name : String := Ada.Text_IO.Get_Line;
begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Hello, Lucy!");
end Hello_Lucy;
```

To use a variable, you must "**declare**" that it exists.  You can also assign
a value to a variable when you declare it.  You write the name of your variable,
followed by a colon, followed by the **type** of that variable.



You want to add more words to the end of that greeting, and there's a strange
looking way of doing this.  It takes two strings, sticks the ends together and
returns the whole thing as a larger string.
